# Express.js Route Handler: Missing Comprehensive Error Handling

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: insufficient error handling.  The `bug.js` file shows a route that lacks proper error handling, potentially leading to unexpected behavior and security vulnerabilities. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with improved error handling.

## Bug

The original code lacks comprehensive error handling, including:

* **Missing handling for database errors:** If a database error occurs, the error is logged to the console but not communicated to the client.
* **Inadequate handling of non-existent resources:** A `204 No Content` status code is returned when a user is not found, which might be misinterpreted by the client.
* **Missing input validation:** The code does not validate the user ID, making it vulnerable to various attacks.

## Solution

The solution addresses these issues by:

* **Explicit error handling:** Properly catches and handles database errors, sending appropriate error responses to the client with relevant HTTP status codes.
* **Improved resource handling:** Sends a `404 Not Found` response when a user is not found.
* **Input sanitization/validation:** (This would ideally be implemented, though omitted from this specific solution for brevity.)

This example highlights the importance of robust error handling for creating secure and reliable Express.js applications.
